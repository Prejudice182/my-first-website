# My Very First Web Page

Welcome to my first website!

This website was created as part of my course for Code Insitutes Full Stack Web Developer course.

You can visit them [here.](https://codeinstitute.net/)

## Project Description

This project was built to familiarize myself with tools used in everyday production environments such as Cloud9, Git and GitHub; how to use them and manage code. The project itself will have a breakdown of the different technologies used in each different section of it.

## Technology

This code was writted in HTML5 and CSS3, using Cloud9 as the editor, and being hosted on GitHub Pages.
